<h1 style="text-align:center;font-size:130%;font-family:courier;color:Black;">Short Biography</h1>
<p style="font-size:90%;;font-family:verdana">Hello! My name is Mahum and I am a 16 year old girl from the Bay Area. Next year, I'm going to be a senior at Wilcox High School! I plan on majoring in computer science when I apply to colleges in the fall. I am excited to be spending my summer at the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program in Adobe San Jose. In my free time, I enjoy binge-watching Netflix, reading, and sleeping.</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;font-size:130%;font-family:courier;color:Black;">Fun Fact</h1>
<p style="font-size:90%;;font-family:verdana">When I was 7, I had a blue fish which, for some unknown reason, I decided to name Fudge.

<h1 style="text-align:center;font-size:130%;font-family:courier;color:Black;">Reflection</h1>
<p style="font-size:90%;;font-family:verdana"> Both Python and Scratch use functions, conditionals, and for/if loops. In Scratch, you just drag and drop your code, whereas in Python, you need to type it out. I liked Python because it wasn't too difficult to understand. However, the case-sensitivity was a little confusing at first. 

<h1 style="text-align:center;font-size:130%;font-family:courier;color:Black;">Circuit</h1>
<p style="font-size:90%;;font-family:verdana"> Today, we made LED lights flash in our circuits! We used the battery snap connector, resistor, LED light, and jumper wires. For me, it was a little hard to see where to stick the wires in the breadboard since the holes were so tiny.
